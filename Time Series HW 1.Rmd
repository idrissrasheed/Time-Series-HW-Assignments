#(b) Solve the given system of equations using R:
#(i) Create the matrix A and the vector b defined in part (a) in R. Hint: Look at the lab 1 files.
#(ii) Run �solve(A)� in R to calculate A-1
#(iii) Compute A-1b in R.> B = matrix( + c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), + nrow=3, + ncol=2) > B # B has 3 rows and 2 columns. ...

            byrow = TRUE) #compile by rows

b <- c(2,-1,0) #Set b as this vector elements

A_inv <- solve(A) #Compute the inverse matrix
